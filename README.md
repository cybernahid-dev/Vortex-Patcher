## 🌌 Introduction 

**Vortex Patcher** (an advanced fork of LSPatch) is a high-performance, rootless Xposed framework. It bridges the gap between system-level control and user-level security by precision-injecting DEX and native libraries directly into target APKs using the **Shizuku API 13** pipeline.

## 🚀 Key Features (Next-Gen)

* **Android 15 Core**: Fully optimized for API 35 (Android 15) architecture.
* **Shizuku 13 Integration**: Utilizes the latest Shizuku service available for lightning-fast shell permissions.
* **Malware Shield**: Integrated proactive defense mechanisms against mobile threats like the **Vo1d Trojan**.
* **Modern UI**: Rebranded and refined interface for a seamless user experience.
* **Rootless Freedom**: No bootloader unlocking required. No warranty voided.
